    <h1>World's Best Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="../img/lasagna.jpg"></img>
    <h2>Just like Grandma used to make!</h2>
    <p>This is a famous recipe just like Grandma's, except that it uses 
        sour cream instead of the traditional cheeses. It goes great with 
        birthday dinners and special occasions. This makes a large amount. 
        Halve the recipe when making it for less than four people. It is 
        very cheesy therefore some people might like to add a little 
        extra tomato sauce.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>(8 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>½ pound ground pork sausage</1i>
        <li>½ pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried parsley</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) container sour cream</li>
        <li>3 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped pitted green olives</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 (12 ounce) packages shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li> 
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling 
            boil over high heat. Stir in the lasagna noodles, and return to a 
            boil. Cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has 
            cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. 
            Drain.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and cook and stir the 
            sausage, ground beef, and garlic until the meat is crumbly, evenly 
            browned, and no longer pink. Drain any excess grease. Stir in the 
            diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, parsley, basil, oregano, and sugar. 
            Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low, 
            and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thickened, 
            about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir together the sour cream, eggs, Parmesan cheese, green olives, 
            salt, black pepper, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese in a bowl.</li>
        <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce evenly 
            over the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking pan. Cover with 1/3 of the 
            lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the remaining meat sauce, 1/3 of the sour 
            cream mixture. Repeat this layering 2 more times. Sprinkle the 
            remaining mozzarella cheese evenly over the lasagna.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the sauce is bubbly and the top is 
            golden brown, about 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
