    <h2>A classic favorite!</h2>
    <p>This classic baked mac and cheese recipe with a buttered 
        bread crumb topping is creamy and comforting. It's easy 
        to make the cheese sauce from scratch on your stovetop, 
        starting with a roux and adding milk, Cheddar, and Parmesan, 
        resulting in a rich, decadent sauce that coats every nook and 
        cranny of the noodles. Serve this comfort-food macaroni and 
        cheese casserole with grilled meats, sloppy Joes, fried 
        chicken or alongside a salad for a meatless dinner. </p>
    <p>This homemade mac and cheese recipe uses a classic mixture 
        of sharp Cheddar and Parmesan. Cheddar is a fantastic base, 
        while Parmesan adds a more complex and salty flavor. Of course, 
        you can adapt this recipe to suit your taste: Gruyere, Monterey 
        Jack, and Gouda are all great options for macaroni and cheese. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Macaroni: This homemade mac and cheese starts with a box 
            of uncooked macaroni noodles.</li>
        <li>Butter and flour: You'll need butter and flour to make a 
            roux for the cheese sauce. You'll also need two tablespoons 
            of butter for the topping.</li>
        <li>Milk: Use whole milk for the richest flavor and texture.</li>
        <li>Cheese: This baked mac and cheese recipe calls for Cheddar 
            and Parmesan cheeses.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: Salt and pepper goes into the sauce, while paprika 
            is sprinkled over the topping.</li>
        <li>Bread crumbs: Use store-bought dried bread crumbs or make your 
            own at home.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the noodles: Boil the macaroni in salted water until the 
            are al dente. Drain and transfer to a prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li>Make the cheese sauce: Melt butter, then whisk in the flour. 
            Whisk in the milk, bring to a simmer, and stir in the cheeses. 
            Season with salt and pepper and continue simmering until the 
            sauce is thick. Pour the sauce over the noodles and stir.</li>
        <li>Make the topping: Melt two tablespoons of butter in a skillet, 
            add the bread crumbs, and toast until the crumbs are brown. 
            Spread the topping over the macaroni and cheese, then sprinkle 
            with paprika.</li>
        <li>Bake the mac and cheese: Bake in the preheated oven until the 
            topping is golden brown. At 350 degrees F, this macaroni and 
            cheese should be perfectly golden brown and gooey after about 
            30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
